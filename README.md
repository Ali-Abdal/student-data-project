# Student data project

Python project that analyses fake data of 1000 students that studies abroad the fake data is generated randomly into a txt file then I cleaned it using a script and stored it in a csv file.

Did this project after taking Python Data Structures course by University of Michigan to implement what I learned in a real programme.
